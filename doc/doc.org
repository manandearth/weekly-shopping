* types:

state already has the qty as string and must be int.

* store:

the recipes added come with editable property is it required?



* DONE reset on submit recipe 
Look at onSubmitReset - still isn't working.
running two handles on that listener.

* Validating PropTypes, yet catching errors? and coerssion?

** for coercing 

I am trying this with a parsing namespace under `/utilities`

** errors

One idea is a wrapper handler that catches any error and renders some component/error message


* redux-persist

during development the rehydrated state in the store can be sticky and
update to a previous(not default) state.  Use the `blacklist:` key to
temporarily shake the part of the store that's sticky, same as
`pantry` in the example below:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
const persistConfig = {
 key: 'root',
 storage: storage,
	stateReconciler: autoMergeLevel2,// see "Merge Process" section for details.
	blacklist: ['pantry'] 
};
#+END_SRC
