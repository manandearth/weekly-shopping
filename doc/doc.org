* types:

state already has the qty as string and must be int.

* store:

the recipes added come with editable property is it required?


* TODO reset on submit recipe 
Look at onSubmitReset - still is'nt working.


* Validating PropTypes, yet catching errors? and coerssion?

** for coercing 

I am trying this with a parsing namespace under `/utilities`

** errors
One idea is a wrapper handler that catches any error and renders some component/error message
